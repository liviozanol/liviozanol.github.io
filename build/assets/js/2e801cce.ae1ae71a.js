It has network segmentation, routing, NAT, stateful firewall, IDS, traffic inspection, etc.\\n\\nWhat if you already have a good and working cloud-like architecture and just want to insert some simple ACLs directly on the virtualization layer to outsource traffic filtering directly to the hypervisor, and do not want fancy things like firewall, NAT, IDS, etc. ?\\n\\nvSwitch doesn\'t support this; NSX-T does, but it is expensive... What about VDS???\\n\\nPython scripts used available at git repository: https://github.com/liviozanol/vmware_vds_traffic_filte\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nWell, using vCenter web UI (you can use this [Hands-on Lab](https://www.vmwarelearningplatform.com/HOL/console/lab/HOL-2211-01-SDC-HOL) to check), if you navigate to the VDS itself, and select a portgroup and click configure, you will see that it has some sort of Traffic Filtering. So, despite this almost hidden function (poor UI design in my opinion) it CAN filter traffic.\\n\\n![Port Group on vSphere](./img/portgroup.png)\\n\\n\\nIf you snoop the web interface a little bit you will \xa0see that this looks like a normal network equipment ACL using the classic 5 tuples (src IP, dst IP, L4 protocol, src port, dst port) and input/output direction to apply the filter.\\n\\n![Creating rules on web UI](./img/create_rule.png)\\n\\nOk... So, it may be possible to apply filters, but this UI is not helpful at all to create and manage a bunch of ACLs (nor to give end-users permission to apply it). Lets try with the API.\\n\\n## vSphere API\\n\\nvCenter has a \\"new\\" REST API, launched since version 6.5. But if you look at their [documentation](https://developer.vmware.com/apis/vsphere-automation/latest/vcenter) you will see that it is **very** limited and still needs to be involved to be useful for automation. Hey VMWARE, come on, prioritize vSphere REST API on your product backlog... Oh wait! Maybe you don\'t want to for some reason?\\n\\n:::note\\n*As a side note, NSX-T has a pretty complete, good structured and [well documented REST API](https://developer.vmware.com/apis/976)*\\n:::\\n\\nBut vSphere also has another \\"Web Service API\\" that can be accessed [here](https://developer.vmware.com/apis/1192/vsphere). It is very complete and you will be able to do almost anything with it, and in fact, it is used by ansible VMWare modules. The documentation is not as good as NSX-T and it is not REST, but it is something.\\n\\nIf you search for \\"DvsTraffic\\" on Data Object Types, you will find some interesting things. Let\'s check [`DVSTrafficFilterConfig`](https://vdc-download.vmware.com/vmwb-repository/dcr-public/bf660c0a-f060-46e8-a94d-4b5e6ffc77ad/208bc706-e281-49b6-a0ce-b402ec19ef82/SDK/vsphere-ws/docs/ReferenceGuide/vim.dvs.DistributedVirtualPort.TrafficFilterConfig.html): \\n- You will see that it supports one property called `DvsTrafficRuleset`;\\n- Digging in [DvsTrafficRuleset](https://vdc-download.vmware.com/vmwb-repository/dcr-public/bf660c0a-f060-46e8-a94d-4b5e6ffc77ad/208bc706-e281-49b6-a0ce-b402ec19ef82/SDK/vsphere-ws/docs/ReferenceGuide/vim.dvs.TrafficRuleset.html), it supports `enabled`, some other properties and `DvsTrafficRule` object. Let\'s go deeper;\\n- [DvsTrafficRule](https://vdc-download.vmware.com/vmwb-repository/dcr-public/bf660c0a-f060-46e8-a94d-4b5e6ffc77ad/208bc706-e281-49b6-a0ce-b402ec19ef82/SDK/vsphere-ws/docs/ReferenceGuide/vim.dvs.TrafficRule.html) supports `action` which could be used to permit or deny traffic on match (besides other actions). Also supports `sequence`, `direction` and `qualifier` fields. As stated on the page about qualifier:\\n\xa0 \xa0 - List of Network rule qualifiers. \'AND\' of this array of network rule qualifiers is applied as one network traffic rule. If the TrafficRule belongs to DvsFilterPolicy : There can be a maximum of 1 `DvsIpNetworkRuleQualifier`, 1 DvsMacNetworkRuleQualifier and 1 DvsSystemTrafficNetworkRuleQualifier for a total of 3 qualifier.\\n\xa0 \xa0 - Let\'s check `DvsIpNetworkRuleQualifier` than...\\n- Hey! [DvsIpNetworkRuleQualifier](https://vdc-download.vmware.com/vmwb-repository/dcr-public/bf660c0a-f060-46e8-a94d-4b5e6ffc77ad/208bc706-e281-49b6-a0ce-b402ec19ef82/SDK/vsphere-ws/docs/ReferenceGuide/vim.dvs.TrafficRule.IpQualifier.html) supports the 5 tuples!\\n\xa0 \xa0 - Look! It supports `tcpFlags` also! Maybe we could simulate an \'established\' ACL keyword, creating an ACL which matches only segments with ACK and/or RST!\\n\xa0 \xa0 - Oh no... Look at the description... \\"*TCP flags are not supported by Traffic Filtering*\\". Ok, but we can still create traffic rules...\\n\xa0\\n:::note\\nThis TCP Flags thing really got me the first time I tried to use\xa0DVS filter because this text was only added on documentation for version 7.0... So I tried to use this on the 6.5 version without success but could never figure out the reason that it wasn\'t working... [Check the old version without this text](https://developer.vmware.com/apis/358/vsphere/doc/vim.dvs.TrafficRule.IpQualifier.html).\\n:::\\n\\nSo, to effectively apply ACLs on DVS you need to:\\n- Define the 5 rule tuples using `DvsIpNetworkRuleQualifier`.\\n- Append it to a `qualifier` on a `DvsTrafficRule`.\\n- Set `DvsTrafficRule` `description`, `direction` and `action`.\\n- Append this `DvsTrafficRule` to a `DvsTrafficRuleset`.\\n- Set `DVSTrafficFilterConfig` with the `DvsTrafficRuleset` you just created.\\n- Apply `DVSTrafficFilterConfig` to a port group.\\n- Enable traffic filtering on that port group.\\n\\n\\nSome questions about this VDS traffic filter rise:\\n- How many rules can I create?\\n\xa0 \xa0 - Well, there isn\'t any documentation about this limit and VMWare **must** provide support to your vSphere even if you apply a long list of rules. Well, at least in theory, but I doubt that if you apply 10.000+ rules on your production environment VMWare will be able to help you...\\n- Is it stable? How is latency (ms overhead) and throughput (less pps) impacted by rules? What about the bare metal CPU usage (could increase since it\'s processing traffic to match rules)?\\n\xa0 \xa0 - Really don\'t know... You could build some test scenarios to validate.\\n- Where/When the rules are processed.\\n\xa0 \xa0 - Don\'t know... Maybe it is like the DFW rules from NSX-T and they are processed on kernel hooks giving a good performance... But haven\'t looked for it.\\n- Can I apply ACLs for an specific VM? Can I apply to uplinks?\\n\xa0 \xa0 - YES! You can!\\n\\n:::danger\\nBe careful when using API to manipulate trafficRules like this. There are some functionalities that are only available through API! If you create some certain kind of rules using API you may be not able to see it on WEB UI! Worst: No errors are shown, but the rules are still there! If you want to delete or edit them, you\'ll need to do it using the API itself.\\n:::\\n\xa0\\n## Python Scripts\\n\\nThe vSphere API described before is commonly used through an SDK previously built by vmware itself. A lot of people use PowerShell SDK (called [PowerCLI](https://developer.vmware.com/web/tool/12.5.0/vmware-powercli)). I like the python SDK called [pyvimovi](https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi) which is also used by ansible modules.\\n\\nI\'ve uploaded 2 scripts to github. The first one lists rules on DVS and the second creates rules on DVS. Could have been only one, but that\'s ok...\\n\\n[`list_vds_portgroup_rules.py`](https://github.com/liviozanol/vmware_vds_traffic_filter/blob/main/list_vds_portgroup_rules.py) list rules for a specific portgroup. You pass dvswitch name, portgroup name and rule_id (optional) as argument to the script and all rules for that portgroup is outputted on a JSON formatted string.\\n\\n[`edit_vds_portgroup_rules.py`](https://github.com/liviozanol/vmware_vds_traffic_filter/blob/main/edit_vds_portgroup_rules.py) edit, create and delete rules for a specific portgroup using a JSON file as source. The JSON file needs to have a specific format. In the following example we intended to create a simple TCP rule on port 53 to google DNS. Keep in mind that [protocol number must follow IANA definition](https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml): (this example is also on script help):\\n```JSON\\n[\\n\xa0 \xa0 {\\n\xa0 \xa0 \\"sourceAddress\\":\\"any\\",\\n\xa0 \xa0 \\"destinationAddress\\":\\"8.8.8.8/32\\",\\n\xa0 \xa0 \\"sourcePort\\":\\"1024-60000\\",\\n\xa0 \xa0 \\"destinationPort\\":\\"53\\",\\n\xa0 \xa0 \\"protocol\\":\\"6\\",\\n\xa0 \xa0 \\"action\\":\\"accept\\",\\n\xa0 \xa0 \\"direction\\":\\"both\\",\\n\xa0 \xa0 \\"description\\":\\"DNS google\\"\\n\xa0 \xa0 }\\n]\\n```\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nvSphere Distributed Switch (VDS), along with other features like QoS, mark, shaping, LACP, etc. also supports stateless traffic filtering using 5 tuples.\\n\\nSince I never tested it on production, I can\'t recommend you to do so. If you have some case scenarios for this or have already tested this on a production environment, please, feel free to send some data or feedback so I can share with others.\\n\\nYou could use these scripts to automate VDS using ansible directly (just install pyvimomi) calling it as a \\"shell\\" command. Or, you could use it to create an ansible module.\\n\\nAny feedback is appreciated."},{"id":"full-stack-it-automation-part-11","metadata":{"permalink":"/full-stack-it-automation-part-11","editUrl":"https://github.com/liviozanol/liviozanol.github.io/blog/2022-02-22-automation-11/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-02-22-automation-11/index.md","title":"Full-Stack Automation Part 11 - Conclusions","description":"Conclusion","date":"2022-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 22, 2022","tags":[{"label":"automation","permalink":"/tags/automation"},{"label":"awx","permalink":"/tags/awx"},{"label":"ansible","permalink":"/tags/ansible"},{"label":"gitlab","permalink":"/tags/gitlab"},{"label":"network automation","permalink":"/tags/network-automation"},{"label":"gitlab-ci","permalink":"/tags/gitlab-ci"},{"label":"CI/CD","permalink":"/tags/ci-cd"},{"label":"gitops","permalink":"/tags/gitops"},{"label":"react admin","permalink":"/tags/react-admin"}],"readingTime":2.14,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"L\xedvio Zanol Puppim","title":"Me","url":"https://github.com/liviozanol","imageURL":"https://github.com/liviozanol.png","key":"livio"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Using vSphere Distributed Switch (VDS) for stateless \\"traffic filtering\\" (or ACL)","permalink":"/vmware-vds-traffic-filter"},"nextItem":{"title":"Full-Stack Automation Part 10 - Demo - UI","permalink":"/full-stack-it-automation-part-10-demo-ui"}},"content":"## Conclusion\\nThis series of posts demonstrated how to use some nice tools to build a simple full-stack automation solution that can be \xa0used to automate almost everything on your infrastructure.\\n\\nThe architecture demonstrated is not static and can be modified to best fit a team/company needs.\\n\\nYou can (and should) separate the API on 2 layers: One to deal with data validation and business rules (this is accessed by the user); One with basic validation, parsing and uploading data on gitlab.\\n\\nYou can make an audit function, either together on the pipeline/awx or separated.

Users can use it to get and update info from their WAN sites in a friendly interface. Note that using web interface is not mandatory. In fact, the web page will only convert data to/from API to show on a page, but users still request our API directly and can use it to make its changes. In some aspect this is good, since you give option to users to use any other tool to interact with our solution. They can use for example [postman](https://www.postman.com), [curl](https://curl.se), ansible, terraform, or even building its own web interface if they want to.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nWill be used [react admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin) as framework to build our UI. Their community version is very complete and allow us to build our pages (if they are basic ones) pretty easy. The Tutorial and Manual are very complete, and if want to deep dive in it go check it out.\\n\\nReact admin is a framework built in [React](https://pt-br.reactjs.org) that lets you build a complete admin dashboard for almost anything using react and Javascript/Typescript (you can also use other [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) modules). It integrates with APIs pretty simple and also have a lot of pre-built fields/functions that makes the job of building dashboards much more simple. As UI components, it uses the great [Material UI](https://mui.com/) providing a great visual experience.\\n\\nIt\'s not part of this post to explain how Javascript/Typescript, NPM or React works as this is a whole world for itself. If want you can learn more about them somewhere else on Internet.\\n\\nAs always, all files generated on this section (and on previous) are on full-stack automation github repo (https://github.com/liviozanol/full-stack-automation), so you don\'t need to create it yourself again.\\n\\n:::note\\nPlease note that I\'m not a developer. You shouldn\'t trust my code blindly (in fact, any code). But feel free to use it, change it and send me angry feedbacks and comments.\\n:::\\n\\n## Coding the interface\\n\\n\\nTo build our simple web interface using React Admin we need basically these things:\\n- A file with our [Auth provider](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/Authentication.html) that will receive username/pass as input and validate user permission on the API. Will be named ```authProvider.js```\\n- A file with our [Data provider](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/DataProviders.html) that will query our API and transform the JSON response from it to a format compatible with react admin. If needed, you can also convert data from react admin format to a format understood by the API before you send to the API (we have done this). Will be named ```dataProvider.ts```\\n- A file with our Wan Sites functions that will basically have 2 main exported functions: 1 with a [List](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/List.html) of Wan Sites and 1 with the [Edit(Update)](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/CreateEdit.html) view that user will use to edit a Wan Site configuration. We also added react admin simple form validation for each field on the Edit view so user can have a better experience, but this is not required since our API *must* validate the data also. This file will be named ```wanSite.js```\\n- The ```App.js``` file that will put everything together and make the react admin app available to the user.\\n\\nOn the demo we will use async site update. Once the user submits a change, after validation, data is updated on gitlab and user can make other tasks. So, we need a way to show users if their submitted changes have been implemented on equipment or not and we will create another file for this: ```jobList.js```. This file is a custom React file that shows a table of the last 5 jobs submitted by users and its status. It will be used as an [Aside Component](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/CreateEdit.html#aside-component) on the Edit View that will be shown on the right side of this page to the user.\\n\\nIf you follow [react admin tutorial](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/Tutorial.html) after you create your react app, edit App.js to import authProvider, dataProvider and wanSite, obviously create these files (and jobList), make the ajustment on resources and authprovider on App.js and that\'s it. You can run your app (```yarn start``` or ```npm run start```) to see it working. If you have access to the API from the computer where you are running the react admin interface you can start to use the app. Login with \\"client_a_user\\" (user/pass), \\"client_b_user\\"(user/pass) and \\"admin\\" (user/pass) to see the differences.\\n\\n\\nIf you look at the source codes of the [files](https://github.com/liviozanol/full-stack_automation/tree/master/demo/fullstack-ui/src) you will see that coding basic things using react admin is pretty simple and the documentation and examples help a lot. But as you start to customize elements, things can get very complicated. If you take a look at ```jobList.js``` that is pratically a custom built element using very few react admin elements, you will see how messy things can become. Either way, React Admin always tries to make things simpler to you and sure is much more easier than build your own admin dashboard from scracth.\\n\\nUI demonstration after wall is installed and configured\\n![UI demonstration after wall is installed and configured](./img/UI.gif)\\n\\n## Publishing our webpage\\n\\nJust like our API, everything will be auto deployed by our gitlab runner using a CI/CD pipeline.\\n\\nWe will again use the same gitlab runner that calls AWX. On a production environment, the UI and API runner should be separated.\\n\\nSince we will be using React Admin for our UI, we will use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to build and install our App. Our repo will contain a ```packages.json``` file that is read by npm and installs the required packages and its dependencies. The output from this build are simple HTML, CSS and JS files that you can even run on your local computer. The CI/CD pipeline will just get these files, and build a simple nginx docker image with then inside, publishing our app just like any simple simple HTML/JS application.\\n\\nWill be created 1 repository for our react admin source files and packages.json. Gitlab runner will watch this repo and update our UI container everytime we modify it.\\n\\nAgain, our CI/CD pipeline will be VERY simple, without even testing our application before deploy. Please note that adding more stages with some good tests, validation, approval is very recommended. For simplicity, the update process will be disruptive (stop old containers and running new ones). On production environment, obviously, you should make something more suitable for your needs.\\n\\n:::note\\nThe installation/configuration script will try to guess which IP address is the pyshical IP and change App.js to use it as a dataprovider. If its wrong, you can just update App.js file with the correct IP, either using git operations or gitlab web UI.\\n:::"},{"id":"full-stack-it-automation-part-9-demo-api","metadata":{"permalink":"/full-stack-it-automation-part-9-demo-api","editUrl":"https://github.com/liviozanol/liviozanol.github.io/blog/2022-01-28-automation-9/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-28-automation-9/index.md","title":"Full-Stack Automation Part 9 - Demo - API","description":"Service API","date":"2022-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 28, 2022","tags":[{"label":"automation","permalink":"/tags/automation"},{"label":"awx","permalink":"/tags/awx"},{"label":"ansible","permalink":"/tags/ansible"},{"label":"gitlab","permalink":"/tags/gitlab"},{"label":"network automation","permalink":"/tags/network-automation"},{"label":"gitlab-ci","permalink":"/tags/gitlab-ci"},{"label":"CI/CD","permalink":"/tags/ci-cd"},{"label":"gitops","permalink":"/tags/gitops"},{"label":"fastapi","permalink":"/tags/fastapi"}],"readingTime":9.155,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"L\xedvio Zanol Puppim","title":"Me","url":"https://github.com/liviozanol","imageURL":"https://github.com/liviozanol.png","key":"livio"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Full-Stack Automation Part 10 - Demo - UI","permalink":"/full-stack-it-automation-part-10-demo-ui"},"nextItem":{"title":"Full-Stack Automation Part 8 - Demo - Runner","permalink":"/full-stack-it-automation-part-8-demo-gitlab-runner"}},"content":"## Service API\\n\\nIn this section we will build our service API.

To make things a little faster, will be used [FastAPI framework](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

We will create 3 KV secrets in it, each one containing the username, the password and the tenants that each user can access. API simply queries this data and check if passwords match and checks which tenant users belong. Also, queries to the API will use a Basic HTTP Authentication using provided user/pass and that is also not safe and should not be used on production.\\n\\nOn a production environment you *MUST* use other method of authentication/authorzation.\\n\\nIf you already have an auth system you should consider integrating your APIs with it. If its an [OIDC](https://openid.net/connect/)/[OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) even better, you can use its own specification to authorize and get users tenant based on custom scopes and it also has it own mean of temporary token exchange to enhace security.\\n\\nIf you want to build your own Auth, you need to get this information elsewhere. I like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4Y2DkKbxM0) simple tutorial using React/GO that even uses JWT to exchange messages to/from API. You could also use some free OIDC as [Ory](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/) to build on premise auth system, and we could have done this on this demo, but would make our demo too big, more than it already is.

Thinking in a CRUD way would be something like this:\\n- Create/Enable a WAN site LAN interface (or install/activate/comission whole WAN site CPE, including its PE interface).\\n- Read/List WAN sites LAN configuration.\\n- Update/Change WAN sites LAN configuration.\\n- Delete/Disable a WAN site LAN interface (or desinstall/descomission whole WAN site CPE).\\n\\nAs you can see, Creating/Deleting our service could/should be a staff/operator activity, and we will not cover it on the demo, but if you want, you sure can! You would need to create playbooks involved on these tasks, change your gitlab runner to indetify when to execute each playbook (eg.: by a commit message?), create a way to authenticate/authorize your operators (could even use our Vault user/pass/tenant sctructure - just for a demo, please) and create these functions on the API/UI.\\n\\nConsidering the info above, we will build a [REST API](https://restfulapi.net/) that receives either a HTTP GET(read/list) or PUT(update) request. The API will be stateless and you can scale it horizontally.\\n\\nWe will also use a bastion container using [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) that receives our requests and identify to which API endpoint it should redirect it based on path (eg.: http://127.0.0.1/wan_site should go to our demo API). Keep in mind that each API container is responsible for its own auth function, our bastion hosts only pass our requests to the API based on the URL path (eg.: wan_site to wan_site APIs).\\n\\nYou could also add some cache layer if you want using something like [redis](https://redis.io/) if you have some complex automation. \\n\\nEverything will be auto deployed by our gitlab runner using a CI/CD pipeline.\\n\\n:::note\\nYou could, and it is a good practice, create 2 separated APIs layers for any specific service deployed. The first one deals with data validation, business rules and other things related with user relationship and frontend. This is the API accessed by users and the web interface. Another one would be responsible with basic validation, parsing, uploading data on gitlab and other things related with automation itself. The first one only talks to the second one and never touches any piece of your automation infrastructure. You could also add an auth for this API to API conversation using JWT for example to secure it better.\\n:::\\n\\n\\nThe following picture demonstrate our expanded API layer for the demo (we will build a bastion host container and only one wan_site API container, but could be easilly scalable):\\n![API layer architecture](./img/api_arch.svg)\\n\\n\\nDemo with API running\\n![API](./img/api.gif)\\n\\n## Bastion NGINX configuration\\n\\nWe will keep bastion host configuration as simple as possible, and you should enhance its configuration if needed and can read more about NGINX configuration [here](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide).\\n\\nWe will use [official alpine nginx docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx) and create 3 files:\\n\\n- ```apis.conf``` that will have our proxy_pass redirecting requests containing wan_sites on path to our API. For every API you create, just add a line like this, redirecting to the correct API endpoint. 127.0.0.1 will be replaced by our script with the real IP from our host.\\n```shell\\nlocation /wan_sites {\\n    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:10042/wan_sites;\\n    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/APIs/default_proxy.conf;\\n}\\n```\\n- ```default_proxy.conf``` that will have our common proxy configuration for every API:\\n```shell\\nproxy_http_version\\t1.1;\\nproxy_cache_bypass\\t$http_upgrade;\\n\\nproxy_set_header Host\\t\\t\\t\\t$host;\\nproxy_set_header X-Real-IP\\t\\t\\t$remote_addr;\\nproxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For\\t$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\\nproxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto\\t$scheme;\\nproxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host\\t$host;\\nproxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port\\t$server_port;\\n\\t\\nproxy_connect_timeout 180;\\nproxy_send_timeout 180;\\nproxy_read_timeout 180;\\n```\\n\\n- ```default.conf``` that is basically own nginx default.conf just adding include clause to import our ```apis.conf```:\\n```shell\\nserver {\\n    listen       80;\\n    listen  [::]:80;\\n    server_name  localhost;\\n    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/APIs/*.conf;\\n(...)\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## API code and server\\n\\nAs stated on the beginning we will use [FastAPI framework](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to build our API. We will publish it using [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) on a container.\\n\\nYou could scale it simply creating more containers and changing nginx bastion host config (if not on kubernetes) to load balance between them (please use [healthchecks](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/load-balancer/http-health-check)), or use some more structured approaches using [gunicorn](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/server-workers) or even more complex structures with cache layers.\\n\\nThe created code is simple and structured in a approach more close to Functional Programming rather than Object Oriented (OOP). It has 3 files:\\n- [main.py](https://github.com/liviozanol/full-stack_automation/blob/master/demo/api/main.py)\\n- [check_permissions.py](https://github.com/liviozanol/full-stack_automation/blob/master/demo/api/check_permissions.py)\\n- [wan_api_functions.py](https://github.com/liviozanol/full-stack_automation/blob/master/demo/api/wan_api_functions.py)\\n\\nmain.py is responsible to handle the HTTP requests, check if user have permissions, and send the requests to the appropriate functions that processes them. If a user send a GET request to the path \\"/wan_sites\\" main.py, after checking permissions, will send the request to the function that get sites JSON data from gitlab and return them.\\n\\ncheck_permissions.py is responsible to get credentials from the HTTP Authorization header, check if they match the stored one on vault and get the tenants that user has permission. For EVERY request the Auth Header *must* be sent to the API and requests are only processed if they are authorized on vault. Separating the permission check in functions like this, allow us to easially change how this check is done to use other auth providers like OIDC. The function can do whatever you want, just needing to return what tenants does that user has permission.\\n\\nwan_api_functions.py is our principal file and is the one that we work the most coding. It contains all functions related to the API objective itself. It has functions to get data from gitlab, to list pipeline jobs and its status, to receive UPDATE requests from user and validate it and so on. The biggest and most workly function here is the one that validate the user data on a UPDATE requests. It has a lot of strictly validating rules based on our data definition and is the function that you need to have most care and takes more time to build.\\n\\n:::note\\nWe have created a new HTTP GET path on our API that will list the last x pipeline jobs and its status. This can be used by the user to check if its UPDATE is finished or not and will also be used on the web UI.\\n\\nOn the UPDATE API path we have configured the function to accept a query string that will make the UPDATE syncronous (wait until the job pipeline is finished) or asyncronous (just UPDATE gitlab file with user data).\\n\\nWe have made a separate validation function for user data because we wanted to make some complex data validation besides simple string/int/boolean/regex one. FastAPI has some good options for simple data validation using strong integration with [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)\\n:::\\n\\n## Deploying Bastion host and API using gitlab runner\\n\\nAs stated before, we will use the same gitlab runner that call AWX to automatic deploy our API and bastion/reverse proxy. On a production environment, the API/bastion gitlab runner should be separated.\\n\\nWill be created 2 repositories on gitlab: 1 for our bastion host and another for our API. Gitlab runner will watch these repos and update our API or bastion container everytime we modify it.\\n\\nAgain, [our CI/CD pipeline](https://github.com/liviozanol/full-stack_automation/blob/master/demo/api/.gitlab-ci.yml) will be VERY simple, without even testing our application before deploy. Please note that adding more stages with some good tests, validation, approval is very recommended for the APIs and also for UI. For simplicity, also the bastion/API update process will be disruptive (stop old caontainers and running new ones), but you can easilly achieve high availability for the APIs scaling them horizontally and Load Balancing with healthchecks on bastion hosts. Updating the bastion/reverse proxy container  without disrupting it thougha is more difficult.\\n\\n## Testing the API witch CURL\\n\\nWhen the API is deployed you can test its functions using curl like below:\\n\\n- Listing Client A WAN sites\\n```curl --user client_a_user:client_a_user 127.0.0.1:10042/wan_sites | jq```\\n\\n- Getting one specific site from Client B:\\n```curl --user client_b_user:client_b_user 127.0.0.1:10042/wan_sites/site_3 | jq```\\n\\n- Updating info for site 1 from Client A asyncronous (please, create CHANGED_FILE.json with your changes):\\n```curl --user client_a_user:client_a_user 127.0.0.1:10042/wan_sites/site_1?sync=0 -X PUT --data @demo/api/update_test_files/CHANGED_FILE.json```\\n\\n- List the last 10 jobs for site 1:\\n```curl --user client_a_user:client_a_user 127.0.0.1:10042/wan_sites/site_1/jobs?number_of_jobs=10 | jq```"},{"id":"full-stack-it-automation-part-8-demo-gitlab-runner","metadata":{"permalink":"/full-stack-it-automation-part-8-demo-gitlab-runner","editUrl":"https://github.com/liviozanol/liviozanol.github.io/blog/2022-01-18-automation-8/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-18-automation-8/index.md","title":"Full-Stack Automation Part 8 - Demo - Runner","description":"Gtilab-CI/Gitlab Runner","date":"2022-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 18, 2022","tags":[{"label":"automation","permalink":"/tags/automation"},{"label":"awx","permalink":"/tags/awx"},{"label":"ansible","permalink":"/tags/ansible"},{"label":"gitlab","permalink":"/tags/gitlab"},{"label":"network automation","permalink":"/tags/network-automation"},{"label":"gitlab-ci","permalink":"/tags/gitlab-ci"},{"label":"CI/CD","permalink":"/tags/ci-cd"},{"label":"gitops","permalink":"/tags/gitops"}],"readingTime":5.44,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"L\xedvio Zanol Puppim","title":"Me","url":"https://github.com/liviozanol","imageURL":"https://github.com/liviozanol.png","key":"livio"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Full-Stack Automation Part 9 - Demo - API","permalink":"/full-stack-it-automation-part-9-demo-api"},"nextItem":{"title":"Full-Stack Automation Part 7 - Demo - AWX","permalink":"/full-stack-it-automation-part-7-demo-awx"}},"content":"## Gtilab-CI/Gitlab Runner\\n\\nIn the previous post we have defined our structured data, stored it on gitlab, created our playbooks and inventories and imported them on AWX. Now we will prepare our CI/CD pipeline to monitor changes on our data on gitlab and tell AWX to execute our playbook. Gitlab runner will be responsible for these tasks, registering on our gitlab projects/group and executing a series of tasks once our data is changed, calling AWX API to run our workflow playbook passing our modified data and monitoring our job in execution also using AWX API.\\n\\nAll files generated on this section (and on previous) are on full-stack automation github repo (https://github.com/liviozanol/full-stack-automation), so you don\'t need to create it yourself again.\\n\\nEverytime our gitlab repository is changed, gitlab-ci will get the contents of our wan_site_cfg.json file and send it to AWX as a variable, calling a job/playbook/template or a workflow that will implement the changes on our equipments.\\n\\nAfter concluding this section you will have something like a GitOps for our wan automation service. If you change some information from your WAN site on gitlab repo, AWX will implement it on equipment.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n:::note\\nPlease, note that in this demo we installed gitlab runner using \\"privileged\\" mode and also mapped docker host socket to the container. This means that gitlab runner container can virtually execute any docker command directly into our docker host, stopping, starting, running and removing ANY container (including AWX and itself). This is NOT a good practice, but we have made this way because we will use gitlab runner to also start our APIs and UI container on the demo.\\n\\nIn a production environment, as stated before, its a good practice to separate functions on different hosts (user APIs, UI and its gitlab runner CI/CD on a isolated place from AWX playbooks and its own gitlab runner CI/CD) and if possible creating/using more than one gitlab. The gitlab runner that starts our AWX jobs, does not need privileged access and only needs to connect to AWX and gitlab APIs, so you don\'t need to map docker host socket neither use privileged mode on this runner and could use [docker in docker](https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind) to run your curl/bash commands or execute commands directly on gitlab runner container.\\n:::\\n\\nEvery file for Gitlab Runner config to our demo can be found [here](https://github.com/liviozanol/full-stack_automation/tree/master/demo/gitlab-ci)\\n\\n## Registering our runner\\n\\nTo register our gitlab-CI/runner we first need a registration token and we will get this token using gitlab API. After getting this token we will ```docker exec``` a command on gitlab runner container to register it on the wan_site group. After runner is registered, everytime a file is changed on any repository inside wan_site group, gitlab runner will look for a .gitlab-ci.yml file and use it to start our CI/CD pipeline.\\n\\n## Building our .gitlab-ci.yml\\n\\nWill be used a quite simple pipeline with only 1 stage that gets required credentials from our Vault 2 and calls AWX API to start our workflow job template and monitors it until it stops. You could insert other stages to improve your pipeline and you should consider this if you are making more complex automations. Some examples for network automation:\\n- Add a [Jerikan](https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2021-network-jerikan-ansible) stage to to parse your data and send it already parsed to AWX (needs to change the playbook)\\n- Add a [batfish](https://www.batfish.org/) stage to validate your config after parsing it.\\n- Add a [network simulation tool](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/) stage to test your parsed configs in a lab.\\n- Add a \\"homologation\\" test stage, running another playbook (or changing hostname or sending to another specific AWX) that will implement your changes on some lab equipment and validate its functionalities. Could either be physical equipments or lab routers running on a qemu emulation (see [eve-ng](https://www.eve-ng.net/) for a nice solution)\\n- Add an approval stage making the pipeline wait until an operator access gitlab and approves the changes (or build an API/UI for this step!).\\n\\nOur 1 stage pipeline will use a basic alpine image from docker hub and we will install curl and jq on it to use on our APIs calls. You could (and I think it\'s a good practice) build your own image only with basic Shell functionalities, curl, jq and other tools that you use on each stage.\\n\\nTo query Vault and get AWX user/pass we need a token and we\'ll store it using the gitlab variable as \'masked\'. It\'s the only presumably sensible information that will be stored on gitlab. Any other sensitive data that will be needed must be stored on Vault and queried from it on run time. You should restrict the access to this access token and for AWX user/pass on hashicorp Vault to only allow queries from gitlab ip address, but we won\'t do this on the demo. If you are on a production environment I hope you built Vault and installed it already on an isolated environment with restricted L3/L4 access and will also make the application restriction mentioned. \\n\\nWe will also use 2 more variables on gitlab: Vault URL and AWX IP Address/Port. You could store the AWX ip/port on Vault if you want...\\n\\nAfter getting the AWX credentials, our pipeline will call AWX API to run our playbook, getting the modified data from wan_site_data.json on the repository and simply passing it as an extra_vars to AWX.\\n\\nAt the end we have a simple while loop that keeps querying the AWX API to get the job status and either exit 0 (if the job is successful) or 1 (if it fails).\\n\\n```yml\\nimage: alpine:3.15.0\\n\\nbefore_script: #Installing curl and jq\\n  - which curl || (apk --no-cache add curl)\\n  - which jq || (apk --no-cache add jq)\\n\\nrun:\\n  script:\\n    - PLAYBOOK_NAME=\\"wan_automation_workflow_template\\"\\n    #Getting credentials from vault\\n    - \\"CURL_RESULT=`curl -sk -H \\\\\\"X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TWO_TOKEN\\\\\\" \\\\\\"$VAULT_TWO_URL/v1/secret/data/awx_secret\\\\\\"`\\"\\n    - \\"AWX_USER=`echo $CURL_RESULT | jq -r .data.data.awx_user`\\"\\n    - \\"AWX_PASS=`echo $CURL_RESULT | jq -r .data.data.awx_pass`\\"\\n    - AWX_URL=\\"https://$AWX_USER:$AWX_PASS@$AWX_ADDRESS_PORT\\"\\n    #Querying AWX API to get workflow job template ID\\n    - \\"JOB_TEMPLATE_ID=`curl -sk $AWX_URL/api/v2/workflow_job_templates/?search=$PLAYBOOK_NAME | jq .results[].id`\\"\\n    #Calling AWX API to run our workflow\\n    - \\"JOB_ID=`curl --header \\\\\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\\\\" -sk $AWX_URL/api/v2/workflow_job_templates/$JOB_TEMPLATE_ID/launch/ --data \\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"extra_vars\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":$(cat wan_site_data.json)}\\\\\\" | jq .id`\\"\\n    #Monitoring workflow\\n    #COUNT is used as a protection so we don\'t have ifnite loops\\n    - COUNT=0\\n    - MAX_COUNT=80\\n    - >\\n      while true; do\\n        JOB_STATUS_TEXT=`curl -sk $AWX_URL/api/v2/workflow_jobs/$JOB_ID/ | jq -r .status`\\n        if [ \\"$JOB_STATUS_TEXT\\" == \\"successful\\" ]; then\\n          exit 0\\n        fi\\n        if [ \\"$JOB_STATUS_TEXT\\" == \\"failed\\" ]; then\\n          exit 1\\n        fi\\n        sleep 5\\n        COUNT=$(( COUNT + 1 ))\\n        if [ \\"$COUNT\\" -gt \\"$MAX_COUNT\\" ]; then\\n          echo \\"protection against infinite loop reached. aborting\\"\\n          exit 1\\n        fi\\n      done;\\n```"},{"id":"full-stack-it-automation-part-7-demo-awx","metadata":{"permalink":"/full-stack-it-automation-part-7-demo-awx","editUrl":"https://github.com/liviozanol/liviozanol.github.io/blog/2022-01-10-automation-7/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-10-automation-7/index.md","title":"Full-Stack Automation Part 7 - Demo - AWX","description":"Creating Playbooks and complements","date":"2022-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 10, 2022","tags":[{"label":"automation","permalink":"/tags/automation"},{"label":"awx","permalink":"/tags/awx"},{"label":"ansible","permalink":"/tags/ansible"},{"label":"gitlab","permalink":"/tags/gitlab"},{"label":"network automation","permalink":"/tags/network-automation"},{"label":"gitlab-ci","permalink":"/tags/gitlab-ci"},{"label":"CI/CD","permalink":"/tags/ci-cd"},{"label":"gitops","permalink":"/tags/gitops"}],"readingTime":10.85,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"L\xedvio Zanol Puppim","title":"Me","url":"https://github.com/liviozanol","imageURL":"https://github.com/liviozanol.png","key":"livio"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Full-Stack Automation Part 8 - Demo - Runner","permalink":"/full-stack-it-automation-part-8-demo-gitlab-runner"},"nextItem":{"title":"Full-Stack Automation Part 6 - Demo -Scenario","permalink":"/full-stack-it-automation-part-6-demo-scenario"}},"content":"## Creating Playbooks and complements\\n\\nIn the previous post we have defined our structured data and created sample projects on gitlab. Now that our data structure is defined we can start to build our playbooks and templates. In this section we\'ll build our inventory, templates, workflow and playbook.\\n\\nAll files generated on this section (and on previous) are on full-stack automation github repo (https://github.com/liviozanol/full-stack-automation), so you don\'t need to create it yourself again.\\n\\nAnsible/AWX are only the executor of automation tasks and they are never accessed by end-users. So, we don\'t need to have separation/segregation on a client basis on AWX and you don\'t need to carry about this. More information about AWX and its role on this architecture can be found [here](full-stack-it-automation-part-4-awx)\\n\\nEverytime our gitlab repository is changed, gitlab-ci will get the contents of our wan_site_cfg.json file and send it to AWX as a variable, calling a job/playbook/template or a workflow that will implement the changes on our equipments.\\n\\nAfter configuring AWX, you should be able to start jobs on it to implement changes on remote WAN sites.\\n\\nEvery file for AWX config to our demo can be found [here](https://github.com/liviozanol/full-stack_automation/tree/master/demo/awx)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Inventory\\n\\nOn AWX, you can have different inventories for each Project. Considering this, let\'s define our project being our service in a way that for each service we can have different jobs/playbooks, templates and inventories. You could also use any separation you like (per your company technical areas - good for permission control, per element types, per automation types, etc.).\\n\\nIf you need to use some kind of jump/bastion host to access your devices, you can also define it on this file with variables for all hosts, group of hosts or single hosts. You don\'t need to (and shouldn\'t) keep a password/key for the SSH access here, you can just point to a place where the key will be and get it from hashicorp vault. [read more](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/faq.html#how-do-i-configure-a-jump-host-to-access-servers-that-i-have-no-direct-access-to)\\n\\nSince we\'ll be using a lot of YAML I think it\'s nice to build the inventory also using YAML, but feel free to use INI as well looking at [reference guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html).\\n\\nOur YAML for this wan_site automation project can be like this:\\n```yaml\\n\\nall:\\n  vars:\\n    dumb_var: you_can_have_you_global_var_here_including_ssh_args\\n    ansible_user: test #ansible SSH user\\n    ansible_ssh_common_args: \'-o ControlPersist=60s -o ConnectTimeout=300 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no\' #just to test... on production, remove this\\n    ansible_ssh_private_key_file: ./id_rsa_fullstack.key #Key to use to login\\n  children:\\n    ROUTERS_US:\\n      vars:\\n        dumb_var2: you_can_have_you_group_var_here_including_ssh_args\\n      hosts:\\n        site_1:\\n          vars:\\n            dumb_var3: you_can_have_you_host_var_here_including_ssh_args\\n          ansible_host: 127.0.0.66 #device IP that accepts SSH from ansible (or from bastion/jump host)\\n          ansible_port: 2222 #SSH listenport\\n          ansible_connection: network_cli #ansible connection type\\n          ansible_network_os: ios #variable with device OS that can be used later on our playbook to convert a propper template file\\n        site_3:\\n          ansible_host: 127.0.0.1\\n          ansible_port: 10322\\n          ansible_connection: network_cli\\n          ansible_network_os: junos\\n    ROUTERS_ASIA:\\n      hosts:\\n        site_2:\\n          ansible_host: 127.0.0.1\\n          ansible_port: 10222\\n          ansible_connection: network_cli\\n          ansible_network_os: eos\\n        site_4:\\n          ansible_host: 127.0.0.1\\n          ansible_port: 10422\\n          ansible_connection: network_cli\\n          ansible_network_os: iosxr\\n```\\n\\nIn our example inventory files, remote sites are separated by geographical area, but you can use any separation you want. You can even have a global inventory file maintained by another team that is updated on gitlab by an ansible playbook itself (imagine an initial deploy phase).\\n\\nThe important thing to note here is that the \\"hosts\\" names are the ones used to identify on which host jobs/playbooks need to be executed. So, in our demo, *hosts names on inventory (e.g.: site_1) must match the project name on gitlab*. You could use a field on the structured data (or another file) for this and make an internal name/id that is not seen nor edited by the user, but let\'s keep it simple on the demo.\\n\\n## Building Playbooks and templates\\n\\nWe will organize our playbooks in a way that we can run commands on equipment depending on its Operating System/type. You could do something more structured using templates, correct ansible modules for each command block (e.g.: acl, interface config, etc.) and also use roles functions separated by OS/type, but I think that a more simple approach is better for maintenance and make you less dependent on ansible and its own organization itself. A point to remember is that, since every change on infrastructure will be made through an API that has strong data constraints, data is already more validated than if we called ansible directly or modifying it via gitlab.\\n\\nFor each type of OS we will have 1 playbook (e.g.: ios_playbook.yml) and 1 template. They will be responsible to convert (a.k.a. parse) our structured JSON data received as variable to commands that needs to be executed on equipment. Since ACLs commands are complex to parse, we\'ll be using a template to convert it. It receives our ACLs entry and converts it to CLI commands. You could also use something like [Jerikan](https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2021-network-jerikan-ansible) on the gitlab CI and deliver your data already parsed to ansible so it only executes an action plan instead of parsing.\\n\\nWe will also have a \\"parent\\" playbook that simply point to the correct OS playbook depending on \\"ansible_network_os\\" variable and use \\"import_playbook\\" to import the correct os playbook and a dumb start.yml playbook that only register \\"ansible_network_os\\" variable to use on \\"import_playbook\\" since we can\'t access ansible_network_os before import_playbook. These 2 playbooks are the one that we will create job templates on AWX. We will create a workflow template to link these two playbooks.\\n\\nIn this demo we\'ll only construct an IOS playbook (also runs on IOS XE), but the concept is the same for any OS. Once the workflow and these 2 job templates are created on AWX, to add support to other OSes, all you need to do is to add specific OS playbooks/templates to gitlab repo.\\n\\n:::note\\nAWX latest versions have changed a lot from some previous one. Now, playbooks are run on a AWX \\"Execution Environment\\" (EE) that basically is a custom container image containing commands and python modules needed. Fortunately, AWX already has a default EE with some modules. Sadly, the default EE doesn\'t have netaddr python module needed to make some complex network operations more simple (eg.: creating wildcard mask from a normal mask), so we added a \\"pip install netaddr\\" as the first task on our playbook and delegated it to localhost.\\n\\nIn a production scenario you should consider building your own EE image with the netaddr module. Or maybe, when/if you build your production environment some guy on AWX EE github repo recognize this problem and accept a pull request inserting this module by default.

AWX will query the gitlab repo and update its files (playbooks, inventories, etc.) on demand (or automatically if configured in this way). Also, please note that since this data (playbooks, inventories) have different objectives and requirements from our structured data created in the previous section you should use a separate gitlab or at least use specific permissions to allow only AWX to read this repo (not modify!) and only enable write permissions on an on-demand basis to admins/operators (eg.: update a playbook).\\n\\nIf you have a big automation team or several teams with different roles on IT automation you could have different gitlab repositories with different playbooks, inventories, templates, etc. and each of them only reading/modifying files on their repos. This way you minimize the permission requirements and divide risks.\\n\\nYou can create the repo and submit all files on gitlab using the web interface or git, or you can use the script on the full-stack automation repo (https://github.com/liviozanol/full-stack-automation) and execute the main AWX demo script (sudo /bin/bash ./demo/awx/import_files_on_gitlab.sh)\\n\\n## Configuring AWX to use inventory, playbook and template\\n\\nNow, since ansible files are on gitlab we need to configure AWX to integrate with gitlab to get the files and also create our inventory and job templates that will run our playbook ([AWX job template](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/job_templates.html) is where we link AWX to our playbook). We will also create a workflow to run our playbook because of a Ansible \\"limitation\\" on how to manipulate variables on \'import_playbook\' directive.\\n\\nYou can do this using AWX web UI, but the [script](https://github.com/liviozanol/full-stack_automation/blob/master/demo/awx/configure_awx.sh) will use AWX API, and will make the following tasks:\\n- Create a SCM credential (a gitlab deploy token) to allow AWX to login to gitlab.\\n- Create an AWX project using our gitlab repository.\\n- Create an inventory using our gitlab repo as a source.\\n- Create one job template for the playbook that simply gets the network os name from inventory and stores on a variable accessible by other tasks on a workflow.\\n- Create one job template for the playbook that implements the changes on our router (the main one that \'imports\' the real playbook).\\n- Create a job workflow to link our 2 tasks and link the 2 tasks (these are 4 APIs calls).\\n\\nAWX final structure shown on its web UI\\n![AWX final structure shown on its web UI](./img/awx.gif)"},{"id":"full-stack-it-automation-part-6-demo-scenario","metadata":{"permalink":"/full-stack-it-automation-part-6-demo-scenario","editUrl":"https://github.com/liviozanol/liviozanol.github.io/blog/2021-12-16-automation-6/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-16-automation-6/index.md","title":"Full-Stack Automation Part 6 - Demo -Scenario","description":"Demo Introduction","date":"2021-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 16, 2021","tags":[{"label":"automation","permalink":"/tags/automation"},{"label":"awx","permalink":"/tags/awx"},{"label":"ansible","permalink":"/tags/ansible"},{"label":"gitlab","permalink":"/tags/gitlab"},{"label":"network automation","permalink":"/tags/network-automation"},{"label":"gitlab-ci","permalink":"/tags/gitlab-ci"},{"label":"CI/CD","permalink":"/tags/ci-cd"},{"label":"gitops","permalink":"/tags/gitops"}],"readingTime":5.09,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"L\xedvio Zanol Puppim","title":"Me","url":"https://github.com/liviozanol","imageURL":"https://github.com/liviozanol.png","key":"livio"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Full-Stack Automation Part 7 - Demo - AWX","permalink":"/full-stack-it-automation-part-7-demo-awx"},"nextItem":{"title":"Full-Stack Automation Part 5 - Gitlab CI","permalink":"/full-stack-it-automation-part-5-gitlabci"}},"content":"## Demo Introduction {#demo-introduction}\\n\\nThe past 6 posts were about building the infrastructure needed to implement the full-stack automation architecture described.\\n\\nFrom now on, we will start to build a demo scenario to use it. As stated on the first post, we will use a scenario as an example and will use the architecture to automate one service.\\n\\n#### Assertions\\n\\nConsider these information assertions about you:\\n\\nYou work on a network service provider that serves WAN connections to several clients.\\n\\nThe network topology has CPEs (routers installed on clients premises) that is connected to the provider transport network. You are required to allow clients to modify some configurations on these CPEs.\\n\\n- Clients should be able to change configuration for all CPEs installed on their sites.\\n\\n- Clients must only modify configuration for the LAN interface of CPEs.\\n\\n- Clients should be able to modify configuration for interface description (?), interface IP address/subnet, interface ACLs and helper/DHCP relay address.\\n\\n- Clients should be able to access a web page to make modifications. They should be able to also do these actions through an API.\\n\\n\\nNow we can begin to define our service. Let\'s call it \\"Wan Sites\\". You could do something similar with other services, like \\"DNS records\\", \\"VMs\\", \\"Containers\\", etc.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Defining Structured Data {#structured-data}\\n\\nConsidering the scenario described we can define a data structure that will be manipulated by users. Consider that users may view/change: ip address, description, helper address and ACLs on remote WAN sites.\\n\\nWe can create a structure comprehending these fields. In JSON it can be something like:\\n```JSON\\n{\\n  \\"site_id\\": \\"(string)\\",\\n  \\"custom_site_name\\": \\"(string)\\",\\n  \\"lan_interfaces\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\"interface_name\\": \\"(string)\\",\\n      \\"ip_address\\": \\"(ipv4/mask)\\",\\n      \\"description\\": \\"(string)\\",\\n      \\"helper_address\\": \\"(ipv4)\\",\\n      \\"in_acl\\": [\\n        {\\n          \\"action\\": \\"(permit|deny)\\",\\n          \\"src\\": \\"(ipv4/mask)\\",\\n          \\"dst\\": \\"(ipv4/mask)\\",\\n          \\"protocol\\": \\"(tcp|udp|icmp|ip|gre)\\",\\n          \\"port\\": \\"(1-65535)\\"\\n        }\\n      ],\\n      \\"out_acl\\": [\\n        {\\n          \\"action\\": \\"(permit|deny)\\",\\n          \\"src\\": \\"(ipv4/mask)\\",\\n          \\"dst\\": \\"(ipv4/mask)\\",\\n          \\"protocol\\": \\"(tcp|udp|icmp|ip|gre)\\",\\n          \\"port\\": \\"(1-65535)\\"\\n        }\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe could also start to think on more specific constraints and business rules that our service (and structured data) will have. For example:\\n- The network only supports IPv4 (for simplicity on this demo).\\n- custom_site_name is a field used by the client to name its site for its own way of organizing. Must only have letters, numbers, spaces and \\"-\\" or \\"_\\". Should have a maximum of 20 characters.\\n- interface_name is a string identifying the interface on the equipment (e.g.: gigabitethernet 0) and must not be edited by users.\\n- description must only have letters, numbers, spaces and \\"-\\" or \\"_\\". Should have a maximum of 20 characters.\\n- ip_address, acl \\"src\\" and \\"dst\\", must be expressed as ipv4 \\"/\\" mask bits (e.g.: 192.168.0.1/32).\\n- helper_address must have only one ipv4 address (for simplicity in this demo).\\n\\nACL specific constraints:\\n- action must be either \\"permit\\" or \\"deny\\".\\n- protocol must be one of the following: tcp, udp, icmp or gre.\\n- icmp type and code are not supported.\\n- For protocol types ip, icmp and gre, \\"port\\" must be empty.\\n- For protocol types tcp and udp, ports may be empty (any port), a number (e.g.: 80) or a range separated by a dash (e.g: 22-636).\\n- Each ACL should have a maximum of 20 ACL rules/lines (aka ACEs).\\n- src or dst IPs MUST be on interace LAN range. (e.g.: LAN=192.168.0.1/24. dst or src IP MUST be inside this range. (e.g.: 192.168.0.5/32 or 192.168.0.0/24) )\\n\\n\\n## Gitlab Structure\\n\\nSince gitlab is being used as the place to store the data for all automated services, we must define how to use its structure to make it easy (and usable) to manipulate data for each of these. Gitlab has a feature called [groups and subgroups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/subgroups/) that allows us to create a hierarchical tree for our projects.\\n\\nProjects are the places that effectively store versioned files. In this case our structured data will be stored on these projects.\\n\\nWe will use the following hierarchy:\\n- For every automated service we will create a group.\\n- For each client/tenant for each service, we will create a subgroup.\\n- Inside every subgroup we will have projects for each service instance (e.g.: Each CPE Wan Site).\\n\\nConsidering the above, we will have a group called \\"wan_sites\\" for our service. Any other service will have a new group (e.g.: \\"vms\\", \\"containers\\", etc.).\\nWe will also have 2 subgroups: \\"client_a\\" and \\"client_b\\" (could be any number of subgroups. a.k.a. \'clients/tenants\').\\nFor each subgroup we will create 2 projects: site_1, site_2 (client A); site_3, site_4 (client B).\\nOn each project we will store a file named \\"wan_site_cfg.json\\" that will store our structured JSON data detailed on the previous topic above.\\n\\nSo, if you want to get data from site_2, you can access the path \\"https://gilab_url/wan_sites/client_a/site_2/wan_site_cfg.json\\".\\n\\nExcept for project name (only in our demo), these names and paths aren\'t visible to the final user, so you can make your own structure and name it the way you want just adjusting your API. Example: client->service->service_instance; service->service_instance (client is a field on each instance).\\n\\nUsing gitlab to store this structured data have a drawback on speed and functionalities, since we are using files to store data (even that they are stored on gitlab), groups/\\"folders\\" to separate clients/services and need to make more HTTP requests to get our information. If you need more speed or a more structured way of doing this, you can use something like a database or [Netbox](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or Python Eve like stated before. [Python Eve](https://docs.python-eve.org/en/stable/) is REALLY good for this, and you can identify resources per client on the data itself without relying on folders/groups (e.g.: a simple field called \\"client\\" on the example JSON on the previous section). It also has built-in sort and filter functions using mongodb style query.\\n\\nFinal gitlab structure as shown on web UI\\n![Final gitlab structure as shown on web](./img/gitlab.gif)\\n\\n## Creating Gitlab Structure\\n\\nYou can create the structure using the web interface, creating the wan_sites group, clients subgroups, sites projects and manually creating the a dummy wan_site_cfg.json file on each, or you can use the script on the full-stack automation repo (https://github.com/liviozanol/full-stack-automation) and executing the main demo script (sudo /bin/bash ./demo/gitlab/config_gitlab.sh)"},{"id":"full-stack-it-automation-part-5-gitlabci","metadata":{"permalink":"/full-stack-it-automation-part-5-gitlabci","editUrl":"https://github.com/liviozanol/liviozanol.github.io/blog/2021-12-09-automation-5/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-09-automation-5/index.md","title":"Full-Stack Automation Part 5 - Gitlab CI","description":"Gitlab-CI","date":"2021-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 9, 2021","tags":[{"label":"automation","permalink":"/tags/automation"},{"label":"awx","permalink":"/tags/awx"},{"label":"ansible","permalink":"/tags/ansible"},{"label":"gitlab","permalink":"/tags/gitlab"},{"label":"network automation","permalink":"/tags/network-automation"},{"label":"gitlab-ci","permalink":"/tags/gitlab-ci"},{"label":"CI/CD","permalink":"/tags/ci-cd"},{"label":"gitops","permalink":"/tags/gitops"}],"readingTime":2.735,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"L\xedvio Zanol Puppim","title":"Me","url":"https://github.com/liviozanol","imageURL":"https://github.com/liviozanol.png","key":"livio"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Full-Stack Automation Part 6 - Demo -Scenario","permalink":"/full-stack-it-automation-part-6-demo-scenario"},"nextItem":{"title":"Full-Stack Automation Part 4 - AWX","permalink":"/full-stack-it-automation-part-4-awx"}},"content":"## Gitlab-CI {#gitlab-ci}\\n\\nGitlab-CI, AKA Gitlab runner, is a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment solution built by gitlab. It fully integrates with gitlab listening for changes on repositories and executing pipelines to automate build, test, approve and deploy applications.\\n\\nIt can run on a container and, after a change is triggered, uses docker images to execute steps configured on the pipeline.\\n\\nMore about Gitlab can be found on its site: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Gitlab-CI Role {#gitlab-ci-role}\\n\\nGitlab-CI will be used as the mechanism that starts automation. It will monitor gitlab repositories, detect changes on it and call AWX to implement changes on automated resources (eg.: router). This is its main function, but it will also be used to automatically create containers needed by the API and web interface.\\n\\nGitlab-CI talks to almost every component on the solution:\\n- Calls AWX API to run and monitor jobs/playbook execution;\\n- Monitor changes on gitlab repositories to run its CI/CD pipelines;\\n- Create API containers and also talk to them if needed on a pipeline step (should be a separated gitlab runner);\\n- Get keys/secrets from hashicorp vault 2 if needed on the pipeline and use them to talk to gitlab itself or to talk to full-stack automation APIs.\\n\\n\\nGitlab-CI will be running with privileged mode so it can access docker socket and create, update and delete containers on the host itself. This is needed because Gitlab-CI will be responsible for managing API and web interface containers.\\n\\nFor its automation function on this architecture itself gitlab-ci only needs to get data on gitlab and call AWX REST API, so no privileged mode is required and you could use something like [docker in docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker) to run it or a direct shell script. It is a good idea to separate functions as stated before.\\n\\n\\n![Gitlab-CI role on architecture](./img/gitlab-ci_arch.svg)\\n\\n## Gitlab-CI Alternatives {#gitlab-ci-alternatives}\\n\\nYou can change Gitlab-CI to other CI/CD tools very easily. It is important to note that we are using it because of its tighty integration with gitlab itself and we will be able to query the gitlab API to know which step we are in the pipeline so we can notify the user about its request.\\n\\nSo, feel free to use other tools like CircleCI, Jenkins, Travis, whatever.\\n\\nYou could also choose to not use a CI/CD as an element that starts automation. If you decide, for example, to use a solution with python EVE as a database and a MQ to talk to AWX you could have the jobs and approval steps controlled by the API directly with its status stored on python EVE and MQ could be the responsible to query AWX job status and update it on EVE.\\n\\n\\n## Gitlab-CI Installation and Configuration {#gitlab-ce-install-config}\\n\\nFirst, if you haven\'t cloned the architecture repo from github, please do so: ```git clone https://github.com/liviozanol/full-stack-automation```\\n\\nTL;DR: Simply run the shell script\\n```shell\\nsudo /bin/bash installation/gitlab-runner/create_gitlabrunner.sh\\n```\\n\\n:::note\\nYou need to have docker available.

Some cool functionalities includes:\\n- A web interface where you can make all life-cycle related activities with playbooks (monitor, execute, cancel, group, etc.). You still create the playbooks external.\\n- Workflow of playbooks where you can execute one or more playbooks in sequence giving certain circumstances and even insert approval tasks!\\n- Nice web forms with basic data validation to start playbooks execution.\\n- Notification of jobs status using e-mail, telegram, rocketchat, etc.\\n- Integration with git or other sources to read inventories and playbooks.\\n- LDAP and other integrations to authentication/authorization.\\n- And more important: A complete REST API that gives access to all of the above and more!\\n\\n\\nNote that AWX comes with a form to play tasks/playbooks that could be used for more simple automations. If you have small tight teams to OAMP only some infrastructure you could use it directly. But secrets for automated resources could be leaked and I do not think that this is a good solution for end-user direct intervention. So do it at your own risk.\\n\\n:::note\\nTo execute any playbook you can (and *really* should) add a bastion host to access your automated elements, and make AWX use, for example, SSH tunnel prior to connecting to the automated element, protecting it even more from undesirable access. [Read more on ansible documentation.](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/5/reference_appendices/faq.html#how-do-i-configure-a-jump-host-to-access-servers-that-i-have-no-direct-access-to).\\n:::\\n\\n## Ansible/AWX Role {#ansible-role}\\n\\nAnsible/AWX is the \\"engine\\" that will access automation elements and execute actions to implement the changes submitted by the user (i.e. run a playbook) and validated by API and CI/CD.\\n\\n- It talks to any automated resource to execute change actions.\\n- It talks to hashicorp vault 1 to get keys/pass to access the automated resources\\n- It talks to gitlab to get inventories, playbooks and complementary files (templates, etc.).\\n- It receives API requests from Gitlab CI to start and monitor jobs/playbooks.\\n\\nEven if AWX has an approval task on workflows, the solution described here won\'t use it. Since AWX has access to sensitive data, like key or pass to access infrastructure resources, we need to minimize any human intervention on it and also its point of contact with other infrastructure. Only gitlab CI/CD will talk actively to AWX on full-stack automation architecture. AWX solution will be used solely as a way to start and monitor tasks execution.\\n\\n![AWX/ansible role on architecture](./img/awx_arch.svg)\\n\\n## Ansible/AWX Alternatives {#ansible-alternatives}\\n\\nYou can use other automation tools you like, but since the solution is using AWX as an API to execute and monitor jobs, it\'s important that you execute it using ansible playbooks. Since ansible can execute any arbitrary shell and python command (and others if you install it), you can use [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [nornir](https://nornir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [napalm](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [expect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expect), custom scripts, whatever, but it needs to be called from ansible. You can, for example, install custom linux packages on ansible job execution containers and just call a shell script in a playbook.\\n\\nYes, ansible can be [slow in some situations](https://networklore.com/ansible-nornir-speed/), and templates or [jinja2](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_templating.html) like language sometimes are too much complex and boring to write, but for this architecture, objetiving a manufacturer agnostic and wide range automation, its important. If you need high speeds or don\'t like ansible at all, you can use your preferred automation tool through ansible as explained, or just build a new API for you custom automation tool - if it doesn\'t have (and insert a MQ solution as stated on gitlab session).\\n\\n\\n## Ansible/AWX Installation and Configuration {#ansible-install-config}\\n\\nFirst, if you haven\'t cloned the architecture repo from github, please do so: ```git clone https://github.com/liviozanol/full-stack_automation```\\n\\nTL;DR: Simply run the shell script\\n```\\nsudo /bin/bash installation/awx/create_awx.sh\\n```\\n\\nIn this guide AWX/ansible will be installed using docker-compose (which is not indicated for production - should be kubernetes instead). Will be used the [\\"official\\" awx docker-compose guide](https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/devel/tools/docker-compose/README.md).\\n\\n:::note\\nYou need to have jq (used by script), ansible, openssl, docker and docker-compose available. Docker service must be running and healthy (check with ```sudo docker ps``` or similar).\\n\\nAs of 2021-12-07, you also need to be able to execute ```make``` (i.e.: build-essential, make, automake, gcc, etc.).\\n\\nThe steps below are already done by the script, which also makes some bugfixes.

A much more sensitive information.\\n\\nVault 2 stores secret keys/values to be used by the APIs, gitlab CI and AWX. It stores AWX user/pass and gitlab token. APIs need access to read/write on repositories of gitlab to change our structured data and will use the token stored on Vault for this. Gitlab-CI/Runner needs to start and read jobs on AWX using its API and will use user/pass stored on Vault for this.\\n\\nConsidering the sensitive data, vault 1 MUST only be accessed by AWX, and should preferably be installed in a specific network/security segment with ACLs/firewall rules permitting only AWX communication. This vault should only store credentials that will be used by the automation engine (ansible/awx).\\n\\nAlso, rules can be used inside Vault that permits reading key/pass only by AWX (IP based).

(Could be files directed inserted on AWX)\\n- Store the APIs and UI code. (Could be files directed created on a web server infrastructure)\\n\\nIdeally, for security purposes, you should separate it in 3 or 2 gitlabs (1 only for AWX files, **1 for your structured data** (our main reason) and 1 for APIs/UI). Gitlab-ci/runner should communicate only with structured data gitlab and maybe APIs/UI gitlab. For simplicity on the demo, will be kept only one.\\n\\nOn full-stack automation, gitlab never talks to any external element and only receives connection from the following elements:\\n- APIs that need to read/write structured data on repositories.\\n- Gitlab CI that reads pour structured data and starts the execution of a pipeline and call AWX to implement changes.\\n- AWX that needs to read playbooks/inventories/templates (could be a separate gitlab).\\n\\nYou may also need to manually send data to it (eg.: modify API source codes or ansible playbooks). Also it could be used to make a request/approval step for gitlab runner pipeline and \'admins/operators\' can access it and approve this step directly on gitlab web UI.\\n\\n\\n## Gitlab Alternatives {#gitlab-alternatives}\\n\\nAs any other piece of the solution you could replace gitlab with other tools, like github, files, databases or whatever. Also, for the structured data for your API, you could use other specific solutions that should work even better than gitlab.\\n\\nYou could use [Netbox](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) which already has a lot of structured data and a nice API, but it\'s a little difficult to expand (as of 2021-12). You could also use [Python Eve](https://docs.python-eve.org/en/stable/) which is a data agnostic API interface to a mongodb with features like data validation and format, auto sort/filter, historical data and included race conditions control. Really nice solution and fits perfectly on this architecture. Go check it out.\\n\\nRemember that changing gitlab with another solution will need adjustment on the CI/CD portion. You can add an MQ (eg.: activeMQ, rabbitMQ) to the architecture that would make you less dependent on gitlab CI and make gitlab more easily replaceable. MQ would be the mechanism that calls AWX and monitor execution (instead of gitlab-ci), and the API itself would post jobs on the MQ. This would also allow you to insert other automations tools besides AWX, since the MQ would be the solution that calls jobs and monitors its execution. It is a good option also.\\n\\n\\n## Gitlab Installation and Configuration {#gitlab-install-config}\\n\\nFirst, if you haven\'t cloned the architecture repo from github, please do so: ```git clone https://github.com/liviozanol/full-stack-automation```\\n\\nTL;DR: Simply run the shell script.

In fact it can be used to automate any service, but we\'ll focus and use network as an example.\\n\\nThis first post will cover the idea of the solution, its architecture, components and other useful information. I\'ll try my best to not use marketing or specific definitions like SD-WAN, SDN, SaaS, IaaS, etc.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nFirst of all, let\'s be clear about what is considered \\"full-stack automation\\" regarding this series of posts. Full-stack automation is referred as a solution/architecture to fully automate network (or any other services), beginning on the automation itself (eg.: playbooks that will run commands on a Automated Resource) all the way up to a structured data source using gitlab, an API and a WEB interface to be used by final users of the solution.\\n\\n\\nAfter building all this architecture, users should be able to access a page, input some information/value in it (eg.: routes, acls, interfaces IP address, etc.) and watch it being deployed by ansible on a Automated Resource (eg.: router)\\n\\n![Full-stack Auto GIF](./img/full-auto.gif)\\n\\n**If you are on a hurry and don\'t want to read further, the installation scripts and demo can be found in this repository**: https://github.com/liviozanol/full-stack_automation.\\n\\n## The Architecture {#the-architecture}\\n\\nThe architecture presented in this series of posts, which is shown below, is intended to be agnostic of manufacturer and cover any service automation, in a structured, secure and scalable way. Each piece was thought of in a way that can be exchanged by another solution with little/no adjustment on other pieces. You could change gitlab for files, change hashicorp vault for ansible secrets, change the API programming language to any other that you want, change the web user interface for other you want.\\n\\n![Architecture of Full-Stack Automation](./img/architecture_dark.svg)\\n\\n**This series of posts will detail every layer/element of the architecture, also providing a guide on how to install and configure each one of them. In the end you should have a complete functional Full-Stack Automation solution based on this architecture and also a demo.**\\n\\nDescription of each element/layer:\\n\\n- The web interface will provide a friendly interface to users where they can list, create, update or delete data from a browser.\\n\\n- The API will provide a single point of contact for all automation and is responsible to receive user requests on data modifications (eg.: change network interface ip address), validate the data and send it to gitlab.\\n\\n- Gitlab is used as a place to store structured data from users (like a database), and also ansible playbooks.\\n\\n- Gitlab-CI/Runner will listen for data modifications on gitlab and call AWX to execute playbooks.\\n\\n- AWX/ansible will execute playbooks to implement the data modified by users in Automated Resources.\\n\\n- Hashicorp Vault will store key/pass to access Automated Resources and also key/pass to interact between elements (git lab token, etc.).\\n\\n- Automated Resource is a piece of infrastructure that provides some IT service. It can be a router/switch, a firewall, a hypervisor (eg.: vmware vsphere, openstack), a virtual machine, a container, etc. A router will be used as an example. Since we are using ansible, almost anything can be automated. You can even manage a terraform deployment to extend it even further (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/terraform_module.html)! The resource is *only accessed by ansible* and using credentials stored in a specific Hashicorp Vault. You can also use other middle/tunnel/bastion infrastructure to access the Automated Resource through ansible, like a SSH tunnel.\\n\\n\\n## Why/When to use Full-Stack Automation? {#why-use-archtecture}\\n\\nWhen you have services/functions that needs to be used by final users to manage a provided infrastructure by you. Examples:\\n\\n- You are a cloud provider and your users needs a portal/API/console/terraform module to manage the infrastructure you provide (just like current cloud providers: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean, etc.);\\n\\n- You are a service provider and you want(or need) that your users be able to change some configurations remotely for the provided infrastructured using a portal/API. (eg.: create ACLs on a remote CPE router you provide for them)\\n\\n- You have an operation team and you want to provide a portal/API to operators to provise or change infrastructure. (eg.: install and manage CPEs on a WAN network)\\n\\n- You just want to test the architecture or learn more about automation.\\n\\n\\n## Why/When *NOT* use Full-Stack Automation? {#why-not-use-archtecture}\\n\\n\\nWhen you don\'t need/want to provide infrastructure services in a self-service manner to the end user or When you have a small team that can manage the infrastructure directly.\\n\\nEither way, the architecture designed can also be used for any cases on any element. You can, for example, just provide access to gitlab files and let your technical team modify direct information (a.k.a gitops) and leverage on the CI/CD + AWX solutions to implement it on your infrastructure. You can also provide direct access to AWX so operators just complete a web form (like a normal AWX use).\\n\\n\\n## Automation Scenario Used {#automation-scenario}\\n\\nWe will use a scenario as an example to implement a demo for the Full-Stack Automation architecture described here.\\n\\nAssertions:\\n\\nYou work on a network service provider that serves WAN connections to several clients.\\n\\nThe network topology has CPEs (routers installed on clients premises) for every remote site that is connected to the provider network and that router connects each client site LAN to your transport network. You are required to allow clients to modify some configurations on these CPEs.\\n\\n- Clients should be able to change configuration for all CPEs installed on their remote sites.\\n\\n- Clients must only modify configuration for the LAN interface of CPEs.\\n\\n- Clients should be able to modify configuration for interface description, interface IP address/subnet, interface ACLs and helper address/dhcp relay (DHCP server address).\\n\\n- Clients should be able to access a web page to make modifications. They should be able to also do these actions through an API.\\n\\n\\n## System Requirements {#system-requirements}\\n\\nThe simulated architecture will run on a single machine. In a production environment you may need to adjust it by separating elements in different secure segments and adding one or more pieces of softwares as needed.\\n\\nSince it\'s on a single machine you\'ll need some good amount of **FREE** RAM memory (around 8GB), around 20GB of free disk space and a decent CPU. Since this is a demo, you have the option to use gitlab.com (or other gitlab) instead of intalling one and save about 3-4GB of RAM, be needs to adjust the steps/scripts.\\n\\nIt\'ll be used docker-compose and some custom scripts to build the solution. You could install it using pure docker or kubernetes, adjusting scripts and files, of course.\\n\\nYou can run the scripts on a VM using a virtual box, another hypervisor (vmware, \'aws\', openstack, etc) or use WSL on windows (which is also a VM by the way). Running the demo on a VM is a nice option."},{"id":"first","metadata":{"permalink":"/first","editUrl":"https://github.com/liviozanol/liviozanol.github.io/blog/2021-11-26-first/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-26-first/index.md","title":"First Post","description":"Just a first page to keep a record (a.k.a \\"Hello World\\")!","date":"2021-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 26, 2021","tags":[{"label":"first","permalink":"/tags/first"},{"label":"hello world","permalink":"/tags/hello-world"},{"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":0.055,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"L\xedvio Zanol Puppim","title":"Me","url":"https://github.com/liviozanol","imageURL":"https://github.com/liviozanol.png","key":"livio"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Full-Stack Automation Part 1 - Overview","permalink":"/full-stack-it-automation-part-1"}},"content":"Just a first page to keep a record (a.k.a \\"Hello World\\")!"}]}')}}]);
